Case Study Questions: Access Modifiers in Java
 

CASE STUDY 1: Library Management System

 

Scenario:

A library develops a system named LibrarySystem.

 

Requirements:

1. Class LibrarySystem must be accessible everywhere.

2. Variable libraryName must be shared and accessible everywhere.

3. Variable totalBooks must be accessible in the same package and subclasses.

4. Variable secretKey must not be accessible outside the class.

5. Method showLibraryInfo() must be accessible everywhere.

6. Method calculateFine() must be accessible only to subclasses.

7. Method generateReport() must be accessible only in the same package.

8. Method validateAdmin() must be accessible only inside LibrarySystem.

 

Questions:

a) Identify access modifiers for each.

b) Justify the choice of private for secretKey.

 

 

 

 

CASE STUDY 2: Hospital Management System (Nested Classes)

 

Scenario:

Class HospitalSystem contains nested classes.

 

Requirements:

1. Nested class PatientRecord → accessible everywhere.

2. Nested class BillingSystem → accessible only in same package.

3. Nested class InternalAudit → accessible only inside HospitalSystem.

4. Nested class MedicalSupport → accessible to subclasses.

 

Questions:

a) Assign access modifiers.

b) Can InternalAudit be accessed in main() of HospitalSystem? Explain.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CASE STUDY 3: Employee Payroll System (Cross-Package)

 

Scenario:

Package company contains class Employee.

 

Variables:

1. companyName → accessible everywhere

2. basicSalary → accessible in subclasses only

3. deptCode → accessible in same package only

4. bankPassword → accessible only inside Employee

 

Methods:

1. display() → everywhere

2. calculateSalary() → subclasses + same package

3. generateSlip() → same package only

4. verifyBankDetails() → class only

 

Questions:

a) Choose correct access modifiers.

b) Which members are inherited?

 

 

 

 

 

 

CASE STUDY 4: Conceptual Question

 

Given:

class AccessTest {

   private int x = 10;

   private void show() {

       System.out.println(x);

   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {

       AccessTest a = new AccessTest();

       a.show();

   }

}

 

Questions:

1. Will this code compile? Why?

2. Is show() accessible through object a?

3. Does private restrict access to methods or classes?

CASE STUDY 5: Static vs Instance Variables

 

Scenario:

Class NetworkConfig contains:

1. Static variable networkName → global access

2. Instance variable ipRange → same package only

3. Static method showNetwork() → global access

4. Instance method configure() → subclasses only

5. Local variable tempValue inside configure()

 

Questions:

1. Which access modifiers apply to each?

2. Can tempValue be declared private? Why?

Note: Write  program  for all questions.
